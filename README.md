2. Search for `devtools.chrome.enabled` and set it to `true` 
3. Search for `devtools.debugger.remote-enabled` and set it to `true`
4. Restart Firefox after making these changes

#### Troubleshooting Firefox Network Monitoring

If you don't see network requests in Firefox:

1. Make sure you have the required permissions allowed in Firefox
2. Try opening and closing the DevTools panel
3. Visit a different website and monitor network requests there
4. Check the Firefox Browser Console for any error messages (Menu ‚Üí More tools ‚Üí Browser Console)

Note: Firefox has stricter security permissions than Chrome, so some advanced features may be limited.
